## TODO
- add function for adding marks onto the board by a player
    - each empty (unclaimed) div has a fixed size and an event listener
    - when clicked the event listener triggers and a player mark is added. Listener is removed

- add a function where the player turn alternates
- determine when the game is over

## Notes
- Originally had a complex 2d array for representing the board in js and html. Simplified into a 1d array and simple list of divs
